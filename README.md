This project stems from a personal observation: the lack of financial literacy in my community.
Traditional retirement advice often relies on the flawed assumption that if the market returns
7% on average, a retiree is safe. This deterministic view obscures the reality of risk, leaving
many unprepared for the chaos in the real world. I wanted to create a tool that not only
quantifies these risks, but visualizes them, making complex financial concepts accessible.

Recently, I have been driven by a passion for the intersection of finance and technology. I
utilized my current skills (bootstrapping algorithms, data science, and statistical modeling) to
build a more robust framework. By applying Monte Carlo simulation methods, I challenge
standard financial planning assumptions. My model constructs a simulation of 5,000 parallel
lifetimes, transforming retirement planning from a simple calculator exercise into a probabilistic
risk assessment.

This project serves as a demonstration of how CS109 concepts can be applied to solve real-world
problems, through which we can better understand the uncertainty of our financial futures.
